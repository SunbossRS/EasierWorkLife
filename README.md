Welcome to use GitFlow! This is a project who can make the work flow of git more easy.  
When you are putting the *GitUpload.sh* into a repository, you need to create a `$gitflow` to your repository and then put that *GitUpload.sh* into `$gitflow`.  
Use *folderfree.sh* can let *GitUpload.sh* doesn't need to put in folder. You need to put that *folderfree.sh* and the *GitUpload.sh* together and run it.
