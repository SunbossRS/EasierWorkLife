This project is made for some GitHub user.  
  
It can run as <code>GNU/Linux</code> , <code>Windows Git</code>or some platform can run like<code>bash environment</code>.  
  
There are some upload scripts can help you upload quickly.  
  
#### 01. Project upload
You may often type the commands to upload the files.  
  
Now you can use a upload script to upload the things.Haha.  
  
If you want,you can make a new upload script.  
  
#### 02. JekyllThings tools
This folder in<code>/</code>.You can see some scripts files in this folder.  
  
Use the <code>Linux script files</code> to open it.*(If you are a windows computer user.We are also ready some scripts files for windows users.)*  
  
There are the scripts like these:
<pre>
1> Init-MarkdownArticle.sh
2> Init-MarkdownArticle.bat
3> AddItems-ForSiteConfig.sh
4> AddItems-ForSiteConfig.bat
5> Manage-ForSite.sh
6> Manage-ForeSite.bat
</pre>
**However,we recommend you create a folder for our scripts. Because our scripts has a control like<code>cd ..</code>.  
If you are really want to create a folder,please name the folder name to *work* folder. If not,please use code editor to disable or delete the control of<code>cd ..</code>**  
The<code>Init-MarkdownArticle</code>can help you to create a article easier. Because you need to locate to the<code>_posts</code>folder,and create a txt file. Then you have to name the article and change it to *.md* format,at the last you need to type some informations like<code>title</code>,<code>description</code>or other things. How many things you need to do! Use a script can improve your efficiency.  
You can choose me to improve efficiency! Haha.  
  
The<code>AddItems-ForSiteConfig</code>is only work for your Jekyll blog.*(If your blog has _config.yml,you can use it,too!)*. You can copy this script and use it in<code>/</code>.  
In this script,we will tell you what things you need to add into<code>_config.yml</code>. After that,we will modify your<code>_config.yml</code>. The <code>_config.yml</code>is in<code> / </code>.
