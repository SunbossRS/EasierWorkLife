<h3 id="WhatIs">What is Easier-Work-Life</h3>
This project is made for some GitHub user.  
  
It can run as <code>GNU/Linux</code> , <code>Windows Git</code>or some platform can run like<code>bash environment</code>.  
  
It can help you to start to improve efficienty!  
  
A little bit LOL

<h3 id="ToUse">How to use</h3>
The project has some scripts to improve your efficienty. Find a script file and run it. I made these scripts to 2 platforms: Linux platform and windows platform. The linux platform run<code>.sh</code>files and windows platform run<code>.bat</code>files.  
  
<h3 id="ToDo">Start use</h3>
You can start use this project very quickly. Make sure you are running the environment like:  
<pre>
Linux platform:
Processor: AMD/i386
Memory: 10MB or more
Core: Linux 6x
</pre>
<pre>
Windows platform
Processor: No specified
Memory: 10MB or more
Core: GitCMD, GitBASH, Cmder, MINGW with Git, or the environment can run linux WITH GIT.(Don't need Windows Sybsystem Linux)
</pre>
After you have these environment,first,open the terminal and type:  
<pre> <code>  cd ~/ </pre> </code>  
  
<pre> <code>  git clone https://github.com/SunbossRS/EasierWorkLife </code> </pre>    
  

Then,you can see a folder named "EasierWorkLife" in your account root folder.  
And then,go to your repository and create a folder name "worklife".  
**We are really recommend you create a folder for our scripts. Because our scripts has a control like<code>cd ..</code>.  
If you are create a folder,please name the folder name to *worklife* folder. If not,please use code editor to disable or delete the control of<code>cd ..</code>**  
  
#### 01. Project upload
You may often type the commands to upload the files.  
  
Now you can use a upload script to upload the things.Haha.  
  
If you want,you can make a new upload script.  
  
#### 02. JekyllThings tools
This folder in<code>/</code>.You can see some scripts files in this folder.  
  
Use the <code>Linux script files</code> to open it.*(If you are a windows computer user.We are also ready some scripts files for windows users.)*  
  
There are the scripts like these:
<pre>
Init-MarkdownArticle.sh
Init-MarkdownArticle.bat
AddItems-ForSiteConfig.sh
AddItems-ForSiteConfig.bat
</pre>
The<code>Init-MarkdownArticle</code>can help you to create a article easier. Because you need to locate to the<code>_posts</code>folder,and create a txt file. Then you have to name the article and change it to *.md* format,at the last you need to type some informations like<code>title</code>,<code>description</code>or other things. How many things you need to do! Use a script can improve your efficiency.  
You can choose me to improve efficiency! Haha.  
  
The<code>AddItems-ForSiteConfig</code>is only work for your Jekyll blog.*(If your blog has _config.yml,you can use it,too!)*. You can copy this script and use it in<code>/</code>.  
In this script,we will tell you what things you need to add into<code>_config.yml</code>. After that,we will modify your<code>_config.yml</code>. The <code>_config.yml</code>is in<code> / </code>.
