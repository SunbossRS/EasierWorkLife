This folder in<code>/</code>.You can see some scripts files in this folder.  
  
Use the <code>Linux script files</code> to open it.*(If you are a windows computer user.There also ready some scripts files for windows users.)*  
  
There are the scripts like these:
<pre>
  <code>

> AddItems-ForSiteConfif.bat
> Manage-ForSite.sh
> Manage-ForeSite.bat
  </code>
</pre>
The<code>Init-MarkdownArticle</code>can help you to create a article easier.Because you need to right-click in the<code>_posts</code>folder,and then you have to name the article,then you need to input some information like<code>title</code>,<code>description</code>or other things.How many things you need to do! Use a script can improve your efficiency.
