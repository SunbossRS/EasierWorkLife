### About this project
This project was created by SunbossRS myself. So there can be no ads appearing in the product.  
This work was originally created for its own convenience. Later, I think that more people need to use such products, so I open source. I hope this product can help you. However, you may need to have a Linux command line environment first.  
The `echo` display in the product uses the `-e` option, which allows the scripts show to have fewer lines and it is more easy when used.

### Start before using
You need to put them into *your project's* `$gitflow` folder first. If you didn't have this folder, create one.  
However, the rules of the MIT certificate should be followed when using the product.

### Use this project
Want to use this project, you need to use the command `git` in your system's command line.  
```sh
git clone Https://Github.com/SunbossRS/GitFlow.git
```
Then, the `git` is starting to clone this repository project.  
After cloning, you can just copy the file you want in the local git repository to you project's `$gitflow` folder.
