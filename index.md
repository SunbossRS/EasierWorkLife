### About this project
This project was created by SunbossRS myself. So there can be no ads appearing in the product.  
This work was originally created for its own convenience. Later, I think that more people need to use such products, so I open source. I hope this product can help you.  
There are `Jekyll` , `Git` or other scripts in this product. These scripts can be run on `Windows` or `Linux`. However, you may need to have a Linux command line environment first.  
The `echo` display in the product uses the `-e` option, which allows the scripts show to have fewer lines and it is more easy when used.  
But the scripts that you wanna use need to put them into *your project's* `.workflow` folder. If you didn't have this folder, create one.  
However, the rules of the MIT certificate should be followed when using the product.

### Use this project
Want to use this project, you need to use the command `git` in your system's command line.  
```sh
git clone Https://Github.com/SunbossRS/EasierWorkflow.git
```
Then, the `git` is starting to clone this repository project.
