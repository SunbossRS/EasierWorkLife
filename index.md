### What is
This project is made for some **GitHub user**.  
This project is more stand by `GNU/Linux` environment. The `Windows GitBash` or some platform can run it. Apart from `bash`,you can use `Windows cmd` to run it! Maybe I will do well in `Windows`. Haha.  
It can also help you start improve efficienty!  

### Use it
Download the `.zip` format project,and unextract it.  
The scripts to improve your efficienty. Every scripts have their work mean. The Linux platform run `.sh` files and Windows platform run `.bat` files.  
You can also run the `.sh` files on a Windows computer when it installed linux platform! **But,we recommend you don't run `.sh` files ON WINDOWS SUBSYSTEM LINUX environment. Because there is a problem about the Windows Subsystem Linux.**  
  
The running the environment must like:  
```
Linux platform:
Core: Linux 6x
```
```
Windows platform:
Core: GitCMD, GitBASH, Cmder, MINGW with Git, or the environment can run linux WITH GIT.(Don't need Windows Sybsystem Linux)
```
After you have these environment,first,open the terminal and type:  
```
cd ~/
```
```
git clone https://github.com/SunbossRS/EasierWorkLife.git  
```
Then,you can see a folder named "EasierWorkLife" in your account root folder.  
And then,go to your repository and create a folder name "worklife".  
**Our scripts has a control like `cd ..`. If you are create a folder,please name the folder name to *worklife*. If not,please use code editor to hide the control of `cd ..` **  
  
<h4 id="UploadTool"> 01. Project upload</h4>
You may often type the commands to upload the files.  
  
Now you can use a upload script to upload the things.Haha.  
  
If you want,you can make a new upload script.  
  
<h4 id="JekyllThings">02. JekyllThings tools</h4>
This folder in <code>/</code> . You can see some scripts files in this folder.  
  
Use the <code>Linux script files</code> to open it.*(If you are a windows computer user.We are also ready some scripts files for windows users.)*  
  
There are the scripts like these:
<pre>
Init-MarkdownArticle.sh
Init-MarkdownArticle.bat
AddItems-ForSiteConfig.sh
AddItems-ForSiteConfig.bat
</pre>
I will introduce these products at down.  
  
<h4 id="CreateMd">Init-MakrdownArticle ®</h4>
The <code>Init-MarkdownArticle</code> can help you to create a article easier. Because you need to locate to the <code>_posts</code> folder,and create a txt file. Then you have to name the article and change it to *.md* format,at the last you need to type some informations like <code>title</code> , <code>description</code> or other things. How many things you need to do! Use a script can improve your efficiency.  
You can choose me to improve efficiency! Haha.  
  
The <code>AddItems-ForSiteConfig</code> is only work for your Jekyll blog.*(If your blog has _config.yml,you can use it,too!)*. You can copy this script and use it in <code>/</code> .  
In this script,we will tell you what things you need to add into<code>_config.yml</code>. After that,we will modify your<code>_config.yml</code>. The <code>_config.yml</code>is in<code> / </code>.
